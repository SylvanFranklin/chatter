# Chatter
Typst Dialogue template! Quickly create snazzy back and forth conversation
between one or more characters. I like to create variables for all the characters that are talking, that way I can avoid a lot of typing. Sometimes this is even the move with place names or other proper names if they occur enough in the conversation

> I use this for translations for my Ancient Greek class, and it hugely
> speeds up composition times! Killer for any kind of language class with
> translations

# Usage
You can copy and paste over the template, or better yet once I get this bad boy
on [typst universe](https://typst.app/universe/). You should be able to simply
create a new assignement / dialog page with 
```sh
typst init @preview/chatter:0.1.0
```
